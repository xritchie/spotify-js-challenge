Communication between tabs (COMPLETED)
==========================
![Spotify Logo](../resources/spotify-logo.png)

Design a library in javascript to provide communication between different tabs(or windows) of the same browser.

**Points: 3**

* Support only modern browsers.
* You can't assume that you will have a reference to the `window` object that you want to communicate with.
* **Hint**: you can use [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/DOM/Storage#localStorage) for it.
* We only need to pass basic string messages.
